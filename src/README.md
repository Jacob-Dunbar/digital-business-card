## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - development environment

### What I learned

This was my first project using React, and was definitely a steep learning curve. However, I really enjoyed the project and can see how React's composability and declarative programming can help developers save time when creating user interfaces.

I used Vite for my development server as recommended by the scrimba course instructor, which required further use of the terminal. I am beginning to feel at home using the terminal now which I never would have expected in the beginning.

This was also the first project that I initialised on git and GitHub from the outset, committing in chunks and attempting to write clean and descriptive commit messages. I can see how this would be especially important when working within a team.

### Continued development

This was just a static site, so I still clearly have a lot to learn about React. I am looking forward to the next lessons and projects in this course.

I love using Font Awesome icons but was unsuccessful in getting them to import on this project (I ended up downloading the SVGs). I would really like to figure out how to do that properly in the next project.

### Useful resources

- [Convention Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - A really useful reference with guidelines on how to write concise commit messages that are useful to both humans and machines.
- [HTML5 Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - I was given some feedback recently on one of my Frontend Mentor solutions that I should try to use semantic HTML5 elements in place of generic <div>s where possible, to help screen readers and accessibility. This page helped me identify where these more meaningful and descriptive tags could be used.
